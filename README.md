# exercise-strings
## Goal
The goal of this exercise is to reinforce your ability to work effectively with strings.

You are provided with the stub of a file that implements a module. Since this is a pettern you will encounter in many modern javascript libraries I think it is a good starting point

Your challenge is to write code that lets you pass each of the unit tests provided. That's it. 

## Strategy
Start by simply getting the first test case to pass. After that, tackle them in order, enabling the next test case to run in addition to the ones you previously passed. Try to avoid letting previously passed tests fail. Your initial run through may be sloppy but don't worry about that (no one is looking!)... just get the tests passing. Once you have passed all of the tests consider how you could optimize or otherwise improve your code. Look at readability, neatness, organization, efficiency and anything else that you think should be considered.

## Setup
This code requires node and jasmine-node in order to run the tests. Please install these tools as needed.

## Run
Execute the tests from the command line with:

    $ jasmine-node exercise-strings-test.spec.js
